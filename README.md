Import the project into your IDE:

Open NetBeans or any JEE-supporting IDE.
Import the project as a Maven or Dynamic Web Project.
Configure the Database:

Set up your database (e.g., MySQL or any supported DBMS).
Configure persistence.xml with your database connection details.
Ensure the JDBC driver is added to the project classpath.
Build and Deploy:

Build the project using Maven.
Deploy the application to a JEE-compliant server (e.g., Apache TomEE, WildFly, etc.).
Technologies Used
Java EE: Servlets, JSP, EJB
JPA (Java Persistence API): For mapping entities and handling ORM.
JPQL (Java Persistence Query Language): For executing SQL-like queries.
JDBC: For database connection.
Maven: For project management and dependency resolution.
TomEE/WildFly/Glassfish: Application server.
Usage
Run the Application:

Once deployed, access the web app by navigating to http://localhost:8080/your-app-name.
The JSP pages will dynamically display content retrieved from the database.
JPQL Queries:

The application uses JPQL to perform database queries like SELECT, JOIN, WHERE, and SQL functions like COUNT(), SUM(), etc.
These queries are executed within EJBs and displayed through Servlets and JSP.
Features
JPA Entity Mapping: Simplified entity mapping using JPA annotations.
EJB Business Logic: Modular business logic implemented using EJBs.
Dynamic Content: Data retrieval and display through Servlets and JSP pages.
JPQL Queries: Use of SQL-like syntax for querying database entities.
